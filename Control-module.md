Control module is HTTP module which makes it possible to control rtmp module from outside using HTTP protocol. Here's an example of how to enable control.

    http {
    ...
        server {
            listen       8080;
            server_name  localhost;
            ....
            location /control {
                rtmp_control all;
            }
         }
    }

There are several sub-modules within control module each controlling a different feature.
# Record
This sub-module starts and stops recordings created with _manual_ flag.
Syntax:

    http://server.com/control/record/start|stop?srv=SRV&app=APP&name=NAME&rec=REC

* srv=SRV - optional server{} block number within rtmp{} block, default to first server{} block
* app=APP - required application name
* name=NAME - required stream name
* rec=REC - optional recorder name, defaults to root (unnamed) recorder

Example

    rtmp {
        server {
            listen 1935;
            application myapp {
                live on;
                recorder rec1 {
                   record all manual;
                   record_suffix all.flv;
                   record_path /tmp/rec;
                   record_unique on;
               }
           }
        }
    }

Publish the stream with the following command

    ffmpeg -i http://someserver.com/mychannel.ts -c:v copy -c:a nellymoser -ar 44100 -ac 1 -f flv rtmp://localhost/myapp/mystream

Use the following commands to start and stop recording

    curl http://localhost:8080/control/record/start?app=myapp&name=mystream&rec=rec1
    curl http://localhost:8080/control/record/stop?app=myapp&name=mystream&rec=rec1

# Drop
This sub-module provides a simple way to drop client connection.
Syntax:

    http://server.com/control/drop/publisher|subscriber|client?srv=SRV&app=APP&name=NAME&addr=ADDR&clientid=CLIENTID

* srv, app, name - the same as above
* addr - optional client address (the same as returned by rtmp_stat)
* clientid - optional nginx client id (displayed in log and stat) 

The first method ```drop/publisher``` drops publisher connection. The second ```drop/client``` drops every connection matching ```addr``` argument or all clients (including publisher) if ```addr``` is not specified.

Examples

    curl http://localhost:8080/control/drop/publisher?app=myapp&name=mystream
    curl http://localhost:8080/control/drop/client?app=myapp&name=mystream
    curl http://localhost:8080/control/drop/client?app=myapp&name=mystream&addr=192.168.0.1
    curl http://localhost:8080/control/drop/client?app=myapp&name=mystream&clientid=1

# Redirect
Redirect play/publish client to a new stream.
Syntax:

    http://server.com/control/redirect/publisher|subscriber|client?srv=SRV&app=APP&name=NAME&addr=ADDR&clientid=CLIENTID

* srv, app, name, addr, clients - the same as above
